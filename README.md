# SKT_DS_04_Traffic_Accident_Analysis
Analyze US traffic accident data to identify patterns based on time, weather, and location using Python and data visualization.

🛣️ Traffic Accident Analysis (US)
This project dives into a real-world traffic accident dataset from the US to uncover meaningful patterns about when, where, and under what conditions accidents are most likely to occur.

Using Python, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized over 7.7 million records to answer questions like:

🕒 What time of day do most accidents happen?

🌧️ Does weather affect accident frequency?

📅 Which days of the week are riskier?

📍 Where are the accident hotspots?

The goal is to turn raw accident data into actionable insights using data science tools like:

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn for plotting

Folium for interactive maps

This kind of analysis can help city planners, transport departments, and safety advocates make better, data-driven decisions to reduce traffic incidents.
